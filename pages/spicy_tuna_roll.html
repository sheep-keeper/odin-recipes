            <li>1½ cups sushi rice (cooked and seasoned)</li>
            <li>4 oz sashimi-grade tuna</li>
            <li>3 tsp sriracha sauce
            </li>
            <li>½ tsp toasted sesame oil
            </li>
            <li>2 green onions/scallions (cut into thin rounds; set aside some for the topping)
            </li>
            <li>1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed) (cut in half crosswise; <strong>half sheet per roll</strong>)
            </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds (divided)
            </li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make the vinegared water for dipping your fingers (tezu) by combining ¼ cup water and 2 tsp rice vinegar (unseasoned) in a small bowl. Tip: Dipping your fingers prevents rice from sticking to them.</li>
            <li>Cut 4 oz sashimi-grade tuna into ¼-inch (0.5-cm) cubes; alternatively, you can mince the tuna.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the tuna, 3 tsp sriracha sauce, ½ tsp toasted sesame oil, and most of the sliced 2 green onions/scallions (set aside some for topping each roll).</li>
            <li>Cut your 1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed) in half crosswise. Lay a half nori sheet, shiny side down, on a bamboo sushi mat covered with a layer of plastic film. Wet your fingers in the tezu and spread ¾ cup (110 g) sushi rice evenly onto the nori sheet. Sprinkle the rice with 1 Tbsp of the total 2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds called for in this recipe.</li>
            <li>Turn the sheet of nori over so that the rice side is facing down against the plastic wrap. Line the edge of the nori sheet at the bottom end of the bamboo mat. Place half of the tuna mixture (if you‘re making 2 rolls) in a thin row along the bottom end of the nori sheet.</li>
            <li>Grab the bottom edge of the bamboo mat while keeping the fillings in place with your fingers and roll into a tight cylinder. Lift the edge of the bamboo mat and continue to roll it forward while keeping gentle pressure on the mat. Repeat with the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>With a very sharp knife, cut the Spicy Tuna Roll in half and then cut each half into 3 pieces. Clean the knife with a damp cloth every few cuts. When you cut sushi rolls, dip your fingers in tezu or cover the roll with plastic, so the rice won‘t stick to your hands.</li>
            <li>Put a dollop of Homemade Spicy Mayo on top of each sushi piece and garnish with the remaining green onion.</li>
        </ol>
